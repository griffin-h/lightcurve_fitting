v0.4.0 (2022-02-08)
-------------------
* Fix bug in min/max validity times when using intrinsic scatter parameter
* Change prior on blackbody temperature from log-uniform to uniform
* Don't italicize some filter names
* Return axes objects in light curve corner plot
* Give option to plot magnitudes in light curve corner plot
* Fix plotting of wavelength when units are supplied
* Add option to calculate phase in rest-frame hours
